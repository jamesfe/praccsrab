Practical Scrabble
==================

This is an effort by which I want to identify key words to know in Scrabble.  Everybody knows that you should memorize two-letter words, and some three letter words, but what about some other words?

For instance, given a sack of tiles with a certain distribution, if you pull 7 tiles, you should be able to make a word out of all your tiles as often as possible.

This software will define a class (ScrabbleGame) that will allow you to make calls to it in order to learn more about the numerical side of Scrabble.

Eventually, there will be an interface by which to query to find words to fit certain situations.

Thanks,
